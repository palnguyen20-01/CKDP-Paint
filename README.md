## Core requirements (7/7 points)

- [x] Dynamically load all graphic objects that can be drawn from external DLL files
- [x] The user can choose which object to draw
- [x] The user can see the preview of the object they want to draw
- [x] The user can finish the drawing preview and their change becomes permanent with previously drawn objects
- [x] The list of drawn objects can be saved and loaded again for continuing later
- [x] Save and load all drawn objects as an image in bmp/png/jpg format (rasterization). Just one format is fine. No need to save in all three formats.

## Improvements (3/3 points)

- [x] Allow the user to change the color, pen width, stroke type (dash, dot, dash dot dot...)
- [x] Adding image to the canvas
- [x] Drag & Drop
- [x] Zooming
- [x] Cut / Copy / Paste
- [x] Undo, Redo
- [x] Fill color by boundaries (If the area is large, it will take much time to be completed)

## Recommended points: 10/10 points
